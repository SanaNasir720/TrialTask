# TrialTask
 
I divided the task into different steps. I have provided the basic functionality which can be improved in many aspects. 
Firstly, I decided about the camera position. I decided to go with the isometric camera because it provides an overall nice view to the user and it's easy to edit objects for the user. Many functionalities can be added later to improve UX for example zoom-in-out functionality for the camera, and camera boundaries.
Then I decided about how to scale 3D objects, I decided to do it with button selection and drag.  Right now all the objects are created at the same position which can be improved. 

There were some things which have to decide by myself which I found challenging for example how to navigate through a 3D scene.
