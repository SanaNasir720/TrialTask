# TrialTask

I divided the task into small steps and did them one by one. Camera setup, Object creation, Object movement, Scale, Deletion, then Remove all the created objects, Undo, and persistence of the application. Later I added another asset with all the functionalities. 

I have provided only the basic functionality which can be improved in many aspects. I completely understand the limitations of this demo task.
Firstly, I decided about the camera position. I decided to go with the isometric camera because it provides an overall nice view to the user and it's easy to edit objects for the user. Many functionalities can be added later to improve UX for example zoom-in-out functionality for the camera, and camera boundaries.

I thought about where should I place which buttons to provide the functionalities. I decided to keep modification and movement buttons with each model.

Then I decided on how to scale 3D objects, I decided to do it with button selection and drag.  

Right now all the objects are created at the same position which can be improved. 
I have used very simple UI buttons to save time. Meaningful UI especially different Icons can be added to provide the user with more understanding. Right now I am using the S button for Scale, M for movement, and D for delete.

There were some things which have to decide by myself which I found challenging for example how to navigate through a 3D scene and how to provide the user with the ability to scale, delete and move objects.
